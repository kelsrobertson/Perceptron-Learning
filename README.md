# Perceptron-Learning
A Python implementation of the Perceptron Learning Algorithm applied to the Iris dataset. This lab demonstrates the fundamentals of artificial neurons, binary classification, and linear decision boundaries using NumPy and matplotlib.

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook implements the **Perceptron Learning Algorithm** from scratch using Python and applies it to a subset of the **Iris dataset**. The project is part of an ISAT 341 lab exploring foundational machine learning models inspired by biological neurons.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the McCulloch-Pitts (MCP) model of artificial neurons
- Manually implement the Perceptron algorithm using NumPy
- Perform binary classification on real-world data
- Visualize decision boundaries and learning outcomes

## Dataset
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository â€“ Iris Dataset
- **Classes used**: `Iris-setosa` (-1) vs `Iris-versicolor` (+1)
- **Features**: Sepal Length and Petal Length

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Example Components
- Perceptron model class with `fit()` and `predict()` methods
- Binary label encoding (`1` and `-1`)
- Feature extraction and training subset
- Visualization of classification results
